# Tic-Tac-Tic-Tac-Toe

I originally made a Tic-Tac-Toe game, but there wasn't anything special about it and it was fairly boring. 
Not wanting to waste a project, I decided to upgrade it to Tic-Tac-Tic-Tac-Toe. The object is to get 
tic-tac-toes on the smaller boards in order to get a tic-tac-toe on the large board. It adds a whole 
extra layer of strategy because the other player can only play on boards based on the location of your 
last move relative to the large board.
